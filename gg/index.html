    <h1>History of Computers</h1>
    <p>
      Why was the computer invented? The computer was invented in order to
      automate mathematical calculations that were previously completed by
      people. Charles Babbage is considered to be the “father” of the computer.
      Babbage was a mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer
      who saw a need for an automated system that would negate human error in
      computation.

    <h1>Poem on Computer</h1>
    <h2>Inside my Computer</h2>
<pre>
  My computer-- disassembled
  is a maze of cables, drives
  chips and ports--an array
  of connections, silver solderings,
  twisting wires.
  
  But when the satiny case
  is latched in place
  coils and cables disappear.
  The smallest particle of matter
  is not an atom, but a byte--
  a particle of magic that combines
  and multiplies unseen
  inside the blinking box.
  
  Creation occurs inside my computer--
  friends, family rest behind the pressing
  of selected keys. Words and faces
  form; smiles and frowns
  become feelings.
  Attraction becomes addiction.
  
  Inside my computer
  merchants buy and sell--
  musicians sing,
  artists train pictures into pixels,
  poets recollect emotion in tranquillity.
  
  Inside my computer
  dreams are imagined into reality--
  inventions, hopes, ideas are born
  and nurtured into happenings.
  Strangers share a table, touch
  hands across the world.
  
  Inside my computer
  the pulse of human hearts
  waxes and wanes
  as people fall in and out 
  of love.
